# Smart Building Automation System

**Team:** Group Quantile  
**Institution:** Arizona State University  
**Course:** Advanced Project Management  

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Smart Building Automation** project aims to modernize an existing four-story building at Arizona State University (ASU). The current infrastructure relies on manual operations, leading to high energy consumption, inefficient climate control, and security vulnerabilities.

This project involves upgrading the facility into a **smart, sustainable, and automated building** by implementing a fully integrated **Building Management System (BMS)**.

## 👥 Team Members
* **Apurva Annasaheb Dange** - Project Manager
* **Aryan Bisht** - Finance Manager
* **Shubham Bharat Raut** - Technical Program Manager
* **Ankush Sanjay Harishchandre** - Procurement and Vendor Manager
* **Yarasi Bhuvaneswar Reddy** - Regulatory Compliance Officer

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Energy Efficiency:** Reduce energy consumption by at least 20% through automated monitoring.
* **Enhanced Security:** Implement smart access controls, AI-powered surveillance, and automated fire detection.
* **Optimized Climate Control:** Deploy intelligent HVAC systems that adjust based on occupancy and weather conditions.
* **Centralized Control:** Establish a single-pane-of-glass dashboard for real-time analytics and alerts.

## 🛠 Key Features
### 1. Smart Lighting System
* Automatic adjustment of lighting levels based on daylight availability and room occupancy.
* Usage of motion sensors and dimmers to minimize waste.

### 2. Intelligent HVAC Control
* Automated regulation of heating and cooling using temperature and CO₂ sensors.
* Variable Air Volume (VAV) boxes to adjust airflow in individual zones.

### 3. Advanced Security Integration
* **Access Control:** Biometric readers and RFID keycards to replace manual keys.
* **Surveillance:** AI-powered CCTV cameras with motion detection covering blind spots.
* **Safety:** Smart fire detection and alarm systems for rapid response.

### 4. Centralized BMS
* A cloud-based system for remote monitoring, data collection, and operational management.
